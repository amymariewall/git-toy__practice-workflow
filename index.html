<h2>

<p>Use this application to work through some repetitive practice of the Git Workflow.</p>

<p>There are two phases to this project, which must be completed in order.</p>

<h3>
<a id="phase-1" class="anchor" href="#phase-1" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Phase 1</h3>

<p>Begin by forking this repository, as always.</p>

<p>Then, <strong>from your copy on GitHub</strong>, create one separate Issue for each item below:</p>

<ul>
<li>Who is your favorite entertainer (comedian, musician, actor, etc.)?</li>
<li>What is something that is popular now that annoys you?</li>
<li>If you had intro music, what song would it be? Why?</li>
<li>What were you really into when you were a kid?</li>
<li>Where is the most beautiful place you have been?</li>
<li>What word or saying from the past do you think should come back?</li>
</ul>

<p>While these are not technical tasks, they represent the tasks you would have in a project.</p>

<h4>
<a id="building-features" class="anchor" href="#building-features" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Building Features</h4>

<p>If you haven't already, clone your repo.</p>

<p>Now you will "build" each of the features for which you made tasks above. In this case, "building" a feature means adding a new Markdown (files ending in <code>.md</code>) document that answers the feature's question. No folder structure or other file convention is required--except that the files themselves should be Markdown files.</p>

<p>Check the <a href="./GIT-WORKFLOW.md">Git Workflow</a> document for the template you need to follow for each feature.</p>

<p>There are many steps in the workflow, and they won't seem to provide meaningful value for such a trivial assignment as this. But they are <em>vital</em> when working on real software.</p>

<p>When <em>all</em> of the above features are complete, using the Git Workflow, move on to the next phase.</p>

<h3>
<a id="phase-2" class="anchor" href="#phase-2" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Phase 2</h3>

<p>This phase should be very quick, if you succeeded in completing the previous phase. The goal is to use the Git Workflow in <em>modifying</em> a pre-existing feature, and to observe the similarities with creating brand new features.</p>

<p>You will be implementing two new "features":</p>

<ol>
<li>List favorite entertainer's date of birth.

<ul>
<li>For this feature, don't add a new file. Just add the information to the document you made before about who your favorite entertainer is.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Remove least favorite question.

<ul>
<li>For this feature, remove an entire answer document from the project. (Just delete the file.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Follow the same <a href="./GIT-WORKFLOW.md">Git Workflow</a> document for these features--no deviations from it should be necessary.</p>

<hr>

<p>That's all. This is enough practice for using Git next week in your pair project.</p>
