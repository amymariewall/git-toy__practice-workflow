Why?\r\n- What were you really into when you were a kid?\r\n- Where is the most beautiful place you have been?\r\n- What word or saying from the past do you think should come back?\r\n\r\nWhile these are not technical tasks, they represent the tasks you would have in a project.\r\n\r\n#### Building Features\r\n\r\nIf you haven't already, clone your repo.\r\n\r\nNow you will \"build\" each of the features for which you made tasks above. In this case, \"building\" a feature means adding a new Markdown (files ending in `.md`) document that answers the feature's question. No folder structure or other file convention is required--except that the files themselves should be Markdown files.\r\n\r\nCheck the [Git Workflow](./GIT-WORKFLOW.md) document for the template you need to follow for each feature.\r\n\r\nThere are many steps in the workflow, and they won't seem to provide meaningful value for such a trivial assignment as this. But they are _vital_ when working on real software.\r\n\r\nWhen _all_ of the above features are complete, using the Git Workflow, move on to the next phase.\r\n\r\n### Phase 2\r\n\r\nThis phase should be very quick, if you succeeded in completing the previous phase. The goal is to use the Git Workflow in _modifying_ a pre-existing feature, and to observe the similarities with creating brand new features.\r\n\r\nYou will be implementing two new \"features\":\r\n\r\n1. List favorite entertainer's date of birth.\r\n  - For this feature, don't add a new file. Just add the information to the document you made before about who your favorite entertainer is.\r\n2. Remove least favorite question.\r\n  - For this feature, remove an entire answer document from the project. (Just delete the file.)\r\n\r\nFollow the same [Git Workflow](./GIT-WORKFLOW.md) document for these features--no deviations from it should be necessary.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThat's all. This is enough practice for using Git next week in your pair project.",
